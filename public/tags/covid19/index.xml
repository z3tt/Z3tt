&lt;p&gt;This blog post originally appeared as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2021/6/8/colors-and-emotions-in-data-visualization&#34;&gt;guest post on the “Storytelling with Data” blog&lt;/a&gt; as part of the color series. Thanks again to Cole Knaflic and Mike Cisneros for inviting and motivating me as well as for your comments on the draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue our exploration of color in data visualization this month, we are happy to share this guest post from notable #SWDchallenge contributor and community member Cédric Scherer. Before becoming a freelance data visualization specialist, Cédric was a trained ecologist, which required a unique combination of responsibilities: in addition to analysing and visualizing tons of animal data, he was also capturing foxes, raccoons, and hares in the wild! Now, he is combining his expertise in analysing and visualizing large data sets with his passion for design to create visualizations across all disciplines, purposes, and styles. We thank Cédric for sharing this post with us, and we hope you enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;font-family:&amp;quot;Canicule Display&amp;quot;;font-size:2.85rem;font-weight:860;line-height:1.2;&#34;&gt;If you are only moved by color relationships, you are missing the point. I am interested in expressing the big emotions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family:&amp;quot;Canicule Display&amp;quot;;font-size:2.85rem;font-weight:420;line-height:1.2;&#34;&gt; — Mark Rothko&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As data visualization practitioners we are both engineers and designers. In our effort to create meaningful visualizations from our data, we transmit our message not only through the particular chart type and title we choose, but also through our choice of colors for the data itself and for any additional design elements. Whether intentional or not, the colors we use in any visualization inevitably spark emotions in our viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;warm-city-cold-city&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Warm city, cold city&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When designing my contribution to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2019/9/3/swdchallenge-visualize-uncertainty&#34;&gt;#SWDchallenge of September 2019 on the topic “Visualizing Uncertainty”&lt;/a&gt;, I depicted the variation in monthly temperatures in my hometown of Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it was straightforward to use a warm, reddish color palette and to display the temperature range in degrees of Celsius. To make it easily accessible for local people, I also created a version in German—and just for the sake of variety and to make them easily distinguishable at a glance, I created this version in a blue color scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/55b6a6dce4b089e11621d3ed/1623092163899-E6CYKSAW3GJTJ9KEGFU0/daily-temps-in-berlin.png&#34; style=&#34;height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain;&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
Variation in daily temperatures in Berlin, in English and German with two different color palettes.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without any intention, the two variations of my visualization triggered different emotional reactions. While the red chart likely leads you to think “Wow, Berlin summers are quite hot,” the blue version may push you to think of summers as rainy and rather cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, we should have in mind that different details might spark different emotions and expectations in our viewers. Some of these details will make it easier for them to understand the chart in the manner the designer intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above example, how people perceive the temperatures in Berlin depends on (at least) two different factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the color used in the chart commonly represent in the experience and culture of the reader?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which range of temperatures (or temperature scale) is the reader regularly exposed to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we cannot account for the last factor, the choice of colors is up to the designer. It is important though, that colors may be perceived differently depending on the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;colors-and-their-associations&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Colors and their associations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which colors do you associate with temperatures and precipitation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Which colors do you associate with trees and urban areas?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are used to attributing certain colors to specific objects and emotions. Most people expect the sea to be colored in blue on a map; a green ocean looks plain wrong to us. Similarly, humans perceive bright colors on elevation maps to represent a high altitude, with darker colors representing naturally low-lying and shady areas like valleys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperatures are regularly displayed as a gradient from blue (cold) to red (hot). A famous example is this “warming stripes” design by Ed Hawkins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/55b6a6dce4b089e11621d3ed/1623092203312-8BKCNNOD9QA0GJUIULPP/hawkins-warming-stripes.png&#34; style=&#34;height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain;&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people around the globe likely agree on the blue-red gradient when it comes to temperatures, and in first looking at this visual, we naturally translate each stripe into a relative temperature (difference) along this gradient. A legend or annotations explaining the color gradient, while adding specificity and detail, would weaken the minimalist style of the visualization, which is communicating not through the precision of numbers but through the inherent emotional reaction to the rapid change from decades of cool blues to warm, intense reds. (Nevertheless, there is also &lt;a href=&#34;https://showyourstripes.info/&#34;&gt;a version with minimal labeling&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;colors-spark-emotions&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Colors spark emotions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which color set comes to your mind when you think about happiness and sadness?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;What color would you pick to visualize honesty?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to emotions, things might get a bit more difficult. In 2007’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.de/books/about/Introduction_to_Multimodal_Analysis.html?id=xSyDAAAACAAJ&amp;amp;redir_esc=y&#34;&gt;“Introduction to Multimodal Analysis”&lt;/a&gt;, author David Machin proposed that lightness, brightness, and saturation can communicate the level of seriousness, intensity, and emotional weight in a visual work. Dark and saturated colors are thus perceived as more dramatic and can evoke emotions such as sadness and anger, while bright and flat colors achieve the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, colors might be perceived differently in different cultures. A fantastic resource in this context is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/colours-in-cultures/&#34;&gt;“Colours in Culture” visualization&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://davidmccandless.com/&#34;&gt;David McCandless&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://alwayswithhonor.com/&#34;&gt;AlwaysWithHonor.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/55b6a6dce4b089e11621d3ed/1623092245319-DMGBMO4S9R14G0A1LYTP/colours-in-culture-iib.png&#34; style=&#34;height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain;&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
The visualization “Colours in Culture” by David McCandless and AlwaysWithHonor.com summarizes the meaning of colors across the world in a visually appealing way.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make use of these emotional values all the time, either with or without attention. Thus, I often come back to the “culture–color wheel” when designing visualizations since Cole showed it to me. We can see that Ed Hawkins’ use of red and blue is an emotionally good choice since the colors are interpreted as &lt;em&gt;heat&lt;/em&gt; [41] and &lt;em&gt;cold&lt;/em&gt; [10], respectively, in all cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bloody-red-covid-maps&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bloody-red COVID maps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, as another example, the famous COVID-19 tracker hosted by Johns Hopkins University that became popular in early 2020. The dark map used bloody red bubbles to display reported infections or deaths due to the novel coronavirus. It’s likely that these color choices elicited anxiety and fear in many of its viewers, thanks to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/visualisingdata/status/1237276833286103045&#34;&gt;“alien-death-blood visual identity,”&lt;/a&gt; as data visualization consultant Andy Kirk termed it at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a black map might be attention-grabbing, it likely also sparks panic in some people. In many cultures, black is associated with &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt;, and red is not only associated with &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;passion&lt;/em&gt; but also &lt;em&gt;blood&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;anger&lt;/em&gt;. As a resource meant to inform the public during the early days of a serious and deadly pandemic, this tracker used colors that, unfortunately, likely inspired additional panic and fear in some of its audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.datawrapper.de/coronaviruscharts/&#34;&gt;Lisa Charlotte Rost and her team of Datawrapper&lt;/a&gt; were among several other designers who took different approaches, using less intimidating colors on a light background. (Johns Hopkins University themselves did the same in &lt;a href=&#34;https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/new-cases-50-states&#34;&gt;other COVID graphics&lt;/a&gt; they eventually developed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rost explained the reasoning from a very emotional and personal standpoint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re infected, you want to find yourself on a map as a blue (or orange, or beige, or purple…) dot, not as a “attention, danger, run!”-screaming red dot. Related, we show deaths in black, not red – it feels more respectful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/55b6a6dce4b089e11621d3ed/1623092295406-ER9FYEYQDE2U7LC6IYD8/covid-maps.png&#34; style=&#34;height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain;&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
The famous COVID-19 tracker by the John Hopkins University using an “alien-death-blood visual identity” (&lt;a href=&#39;https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html&#39;&gt;coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html&lt;/a&gt;; Screenshot 2020-07-27) next to a map of confirmed COVID-19 cases by Datawrapper using more decent colors to avoid an emotion of fear (&lt;a href=&#39;blog.datawrapper.de/coronaviruscharts&#39;&gt;blog.datawrapper.de/coronaviruscharts&lt;/a&gt;; Screenshot 2020-07-27).
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I try to avoid black backgrounds as often as possible, although I will use dark gray colors in those cases where dark scenery simply looks better. Light colors may in most cases be a better choice since the color represents truce [79], purity [67] and trust [80] — characteristics that we all certainly like to get as feedback on our data visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;colors-of-healing-visualizing-vaccinations&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Colors of healing: visualizing vaccinations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing in June 2021, we are in a very different phase of COVID-19 pandemic than we were when those trackers were first launched in early 2020. While we are still collecting data on negative events like infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, our visualizations are now focusing more and more on the positive events: vaccinations and vaccination rates. Many of the charts and maps showing how countries perform on this metric are designed on light backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/55b6a6dce4b089e11621d3ed/1623092352309-DJIK4US9EJ0NJYTHS7MX/immunization-bars-and-waffles.png&#34; style=&#34;height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain;&#34;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
Some exemplary graphs from the “COVID-19 Impfdashboard” using moderate blue on light gray and white backgrounds. The chart is maintained by the German Federal Ministry of Health in collaboration with the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) and was designed by Studio NAND and Moritz Stefaner.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the wonderful &lt;a href=&#34;https://impfdashboard.de/&#34;&gt;COVID-19 vaccination dashboard&lt;/a&gt; by the German Federal Ministry of Health in collaboration with the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI). This dashboard shows vaccination rates in Germany with moderate blue graphs on a light background. Blue is a versatile color, representing many different values around the world. However, by intention or by chance, the designers’ choice of blue is a very good one: in Western cultures the color is not only attributed to cold but also to values such as healing, freedom and rationality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love colors. Ever since my contribution to the #SWDchallenge, I have learned to take even more care when I choose colors and try to avoid stereotypic colors, especially those that spark certain emotions or are associated with features I actually don’t want to communicate with my visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like, creating a suitable emotional setting can be subsumed under the term accessibility: more familiar colors will help the reader to access the visualization and may reduce the guidance needed to explain certain features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, badly chosen colors may in the worst case mislead the reader or put them in the wrong mindset to accept the intended message, which is definitely something I want to avoid as a truthful designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking suitable colors—not only in terms of accessibility but also based on their emotional values—is an important skill for every designer to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 or simply Corona—what started as an epidemic in China’s Hubei province has become a global pandemic, leading to hundreds of thousands of infections and thousands of deaths so far, national lockdowns and quarantines of cities, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/stayhome&#34;&gt;#stayhome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/flattenthecurve&#34;&gt;#flattenthecurve&lt;/a&gt; hashtags—and obviously a global shortage of toilet paper.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the corona pandemic started, I felt scared, curious and tired at the same time. &lt;em&gt;Scared as a husband and father&lt;/em&gt; by the impact this virus outbreak &lt;strike&gt;might&lt;/strike&gt; is going to have on our life, in 2020 and way beyond. &lt;em&gt;Curious as a scientist&lt;/em&gt; who studies the spread and persistence of directly transmitted diseases in the context of contact rates and animal movement. And &lt;em&gt;tired as a data visualization specialist&lt;/em&gt; when I saw a lot of visualizations that were created by persons that neither had the knowledge nor the interest to produce accurate visualizations. Back then I decided against creating corona-related data visualizations for several reasons, some related to my mood, some to the uncertainty in data and the sheer mass of unimportant or misleading visualizations popping up everywhere. However, I have the feeling that the initial spread of misleading visualizations that either trigger panic or play down the risk is mainly over and we now have a lot of data and background knowledge to base our visualizations on. And, more importantly, I had an idea how to visualize and compare the death tolls among countries. (Also I had a reason to create an animation thanks to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2020/3/2/swdchallenge-get-animated&#34;&gt;latest #SWDchallenge&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-idea&#34;&gt;The idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/alexcourtiol&#34;&gt;Alexandre Courtiol&lt;/a&gt;, who looked at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/courtiol/excess_mortality_COVID19&#34;&gt;the worst day on a country-level by visualizing the deaths due to COVID-19 adjusted for baseline mortality and population size&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to highlight where each country falls along the wave. While his plot reveals some interesting patterns, I aimed for a timeline to reveal the temporal trends. Particularly, I wanted to highlight the relativity of the feeling &amp;ldquo;today is the worst day&amp;rdquo; and also the &lt;em&gt;current&lt;/em&gt; trends, either today or a week ago—are we already over the (first) wave or can we expect more and more deaths in the next days? So I decided to take a different approach by calculating the number of daily deaths relative to the worst day on both the global and the country level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://cedricscherer.com/img/dataviz-posts/SWD_2020_03_Animation_corona_sum.gif&#34; alt=&#34;animation-corona-original&#34; style=&#34;width: 100%; object-fit: contain&#34; onclick=&#34;window.open(&#39;https://www.cedricscherer.com/img/SWDchallenge/SWD_2020_03_Animation_corona_sum.gif, &#39;blank&#39;);&#34;/&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;A static version of the situation as of 29th of March with countries sorted by first reported death.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-to-read-the-visualization&#34;&gt;How to read the visualization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As explained above, I calculated for each day the number of death cases relative to the &amp;ldquo;worst day&amp;rdquo;, namely the day with the most reported deaths so far. Imagine a naïve population that was not facing the virus before. At some point, there might be individuals dying but likely only a few (with regard to COVID-19—in general, this depends on the severity of the infection caused by the pathogen, often referred to as &lt;em&gt;case fatality ratio&lt;/em&gt; or simply &lt;em&gt;case fatality&lt;/em&gt;). Consequently, the proportion of deaths on the first day compared to the worst day has to be 100% (since the first day is, by definition, the worst day so far). On the next day, there might be more deaths than on the day before, a known pattern we see in reality and in simulations of early epidemics. Exponential growth, an always increasing curve we aim to flatten by reducing contact between infected and susceptible (individuals that are not infected but able to catch the infection). So on day two, two times as many individuals might die which makes the second day the worst day with a proportion of 100%. At the same time, the proportion of deaths on day one decreases from 100% to 50%. This way of transforming the data enables to see if we are still facing (exponential) growth or if we, at least for now, over the peak if deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;things-to-keep-in-mind-when-visualizing-covid-19-data&#34;&gt;Things to keep in mind when visualizing COVID-19 data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the recent weeks, there is a lot of discussion on several things to account for when analyzing data and designing visualizations on the topic of the corona pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;make-design-choices-carefully&#34;&gt;Make design choices carefully&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, the final visualization should be as precise and transparent as possible. (Of course, this should be the case for all visualizations!) This means that the final product should be designed with care by adding the source of data, how the data was aggregated and analyzed, and what the visualization shows. Further, this implies a careful choice of text, especially the title, and the colors which should both neither be hysteric nor play down the current situation. For example, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.datawrapper.de/coronaviruscharts/&#34;&gt;use of bloodish colors&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/visualisingdata/status/1237276833286103045&#34;&gt;make it crystal-clear that this virus is deadly&lt;/a&gt; might spark panic in some people. If this is an intended choice, this is &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AlbertoCairo/status/1241374480351576064&#34;&gt;professional malpractice and must be called out by us as data visualization specialists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;gain-knowledge-contact-experts-check-your-facts&#34;&gt;Gain knowledge, contact experts, check your facts&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the global pandemic, the intention of a particular graphic was often not clear to the reader. Also, I hardly could tell if the designer has the knowledge to analyze and visualize the data in a meaningful way (no, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1241522140559503360&#34;&gt;you are not an expert in pathogen spread when you&amp;rsquo;re investigating market sales!&lt;/a&gt;) or contacted any experts when preparing the chart. To cite Alberto Cairo, knight chair in visual journalism at the University of Miami: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AlbertoCairo/status/1241371617680293888&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Numbers without domain knowledge are dangerous&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/AlbertoCairo/status/1241386040570626048&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;the rule should be to ignore &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; analysis from people who haven&amp;rsquo;t consulted with epidemiologists/biostatisticians&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;be-explicit-about-uncertainty&#34;&gt;Be explicit about uncertainty&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data we read about and see in the news and our social media streams come with a lot of uncertainty. It is very important to understand that detected or confirmed cases do not necessarily reflect the reality but underestimate the real number of cases—and to communicate this fact explicitly in the visualization. The number of detected persons with an infection depends on the number of tests that were performed—and that &lt;a href=&#34;https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing&#34;&gt;differs a lot among countries&lt;/a&gt;! A more robust measure might be deaths due to the coronavirus but keep in mind that the way to report these numbers differs between countries. Furthermore, &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/26/health/number-of-cases-testing-data-intl/index.html&#34;&gt;no two countries are alike when it comes to access to healthcare and medical resources and even the age structure of the population&lt;/a&gt; which in turn influences the number of reported cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are still in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, correlations with any variable such as temperature or cultural differences need to be treated with caution. Do not release any of such analyses or visualizations if you are not sure what you are doing and did your best to account for any biases. There are experts for this and they are already searching for correlations with the right tools and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;do-i-need-to-adjust-for-population&#34;&gt;Do I need to adjust for population?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a ongoing discussion of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1242904596856614912&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;showing the raw numbers&amp;rdquo; versus &amp;ldquo;adjust data for population&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. As John Burn-Murdoch—data visualization designer at the Financial Times and creator of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest&#34;&gt;these fantastic and very informative visualizations on the current situation of the corona spread&lt;/a&gt;—states: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1242904703144464390&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Generally, and especially early in outbreak (first few weeks), higher per-capita numbers just mean smaller country, not anything different about how that country’s dealing with covid&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, &lt;em&gt;population density&lt;/em&gt; matters since the coronavirus is transmitted by direct or close contact. However, &lt;em&gt;population size&lt;/em&gt; does not necessarily reflect the density in a country. So if accounting for population, this should be optimally done on a regional level sufficient to capture the area of spread instead of borders drawn by influential humans. In the end, it also depends on the story you want to tell if and how you adjust the data. There are also other ways to adjust the data such as those which two ways &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/courtiol/excess_mortality_COVID19&#34;&gt;Alexandre&lt;/a&gt; and I have chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;should-i-use-a-logarithmic-axis&#34;&gt;Should I use a logarithmic axis?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the use of logarithmic axes is another ongoing discussion. Since the initial growth is likely exponential in case of directly transmitted diseases—and this is what we see with the coronavirus as well—a logarithmic scale &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1237748598051409921&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;is the natural way to track the spread&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. While I would not name it the &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; way, it is true that such a transformation helps to understand the dynamics and makes (some) comparisons more easy. But again, the choice depends on the picture you want to draw: when turning the y axis into a logarithmic one as John did, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1237749654281912321&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;readers now only have to draw a straight line in their head to see if two countries are one the same path&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. While with this transformation it might be easier to compare countries there might be disadvantages: the reader needs to realize and understand the logarithmic axis and small differences might be underestimated which are in reality much higher than some might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;benefits-and-caveats-of-the-visualization&#34;&gt;Benefits and caveats of the visualization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By calculating the proportion of deaths per country, I avoid some of the issues with current visualizations on the COVID-19 topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;strong&gt;number of deaths&lt;/strong&gt; which is, compared to positive cases, &lt;a href=&#34;https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/CASUALTIES/gjnpwjmqvwr/&#34;&gt;a more reliable measure&lt;/a&gt;. Using numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 minimizes the difference in testing rates which vary a lot between countries. Though, we have to keep in mind that countries also have been reported to classify &amp;ldquo;death due to COVID-19&amp;rdquo; in different ways and might be underreported. Also, it is known that the risk of dying due to an infection with COVID-19 depends on the age, and thus a country&amp;rsquo;s demography plays a role as well. All this may make a comparison between countries difficult. However, by just looking at the numbers per country, every comparison is made with the same standards which do not differ within countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was &lt;strong&gt;no need to perform any logarithmic transformation&lt;/strong&gt; to reveal the pattern since, again, we compare the absolute numbers per country not between countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;strong&gt;scaling death tolls by country&lt;/strong&gt;, the visualization accounts for different population sizes and states of the epidemic which enables us to compare them more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each country has its on row which helps to see a clear pattern for each country without dealing with overplotting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evolving patterns mimics the way we have experienced and are experiencing the pandemic. I found it very interesting to look at the &lt;strong&gt;change in a dynamic way&lt;/strong&gt; since values that look very high today might be low in a few days depending on the trend. This way the animations mimics us humans and how we see the situation without making any claims about how the numbers will change in the next days. You can also &lt;em&gt;ride the wave&lt;/em&gt; and wait for the new colors to be not pink anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be transparent that the highest color does not show daily cases but a calculated measure, I have added both the number of daily deaths for each country&amp;rsquo;s worst day and the latest day as well as the sum of deaths next to each country&amp;rsquo;s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there might be also some drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer number of cases is not the main focus but added as numbers for the worst days and the latest day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easier to see trends of particular countries. However, a comparison of many waves in detail might be difficult for countries that are not plotted next to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might run out of space soon&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
